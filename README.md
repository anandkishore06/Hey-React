# 01. What is Emmet ?
- Emmet (formerly Zen Coding) is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allows for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist.

- Support for Emmet snippets and expansion is built right into Visual Studio Code, no extension required
